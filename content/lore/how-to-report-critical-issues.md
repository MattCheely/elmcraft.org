## Critical issues

If you're seeing an issue that is both high severity (has a really bad outcome) and high impact (affects lots of people):

- Join the [Elm Lang Slack](https://elm-lang.org/community/slack)
- Post a message in the `#core-coordination` channel tagging `@evancz`


## Non-critical issues

For other issues:

- Report them to the relevant repository as a Github issue (if it's a core issue, duplicate issues are preferred)
- If there is no relevant repository report them in the `#general` channel
  - The community is quite active and will be able to advise if the issue needs to be escalated
