These pages contain history and cultural knowledge in the Elm community written down to make it more accessible to newcomers.


### The writing of a thing changes it

A downside of documenting Lore is that you alter its nature somewhat. You calcify a little its flexibility to keep changing, and you influence future readers.

Like a photograph of a moment in time, the photographer adds composition, perspective and framing (selection and exclusion).

Inevitably there is no objective Lore. Authors leave their fingerprint on what they write.

So the pages under Lore are framed in the following ways to try mitigate some of the downsides:

- Don’t assume, and if you must, assume people aren’t malicious
- The future isn't fixed by the past, things can and will change
- Promote the future of Elm
- Focus on solutions and personal action

All Elmcraft Lore articles clearly mark their authors and editors.
