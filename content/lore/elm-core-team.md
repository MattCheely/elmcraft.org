## Who is on the Elm core team?

The Elm core team is effectively [Evan Czaplicki](https://twitter.com/evancz). He works alongside his wife, [Tereza Sokol](https://twitter.com/tereza_sokol) as [elm.studio](https://elm.studio/).


## What happened to the core team?

There never really was a core team in the sense you might expect.

Earlier in Elm's history, Evan was in a phase that was more collaborative in discussions before Elm developed towards the relative stability that is present today.

The Elm language and [compiler work from a code perspective has always been predominantly Evan's work, as witnessed by the public contribution log](https://github.com/elm/compiler/graphs/contributors). Code contributions were mostly centered around packages.


## What about the `elm-explorations/*` repositories and maintainers?

There are people maintaining repos in the elm-explorations organization, who have access to kernel JS modules, but that access is not being used by those people to make interfaces for Web APIs.

These repos mostly exist in elm-explorations to have access to some escape hatch:

- `elm-explorations/test` uses JS for tryâ€¦catch
- `elm-explorations/linear-algebra` uses JS for fast math over Float64Arrays
- `elm-explorations/benchmark` uses JS for high-precision timestamps
- `elm-explorations/webgl` uses JS to interface with WebGL

These repos are also largely stable and most work is done in Elm not kernel JS.

There are no contributors who have indiscriminate access to kernel JS on any/all projects.


## What about the blog post about Bekk sponsoring a core team member, Robin?

The [September 2019 - Elm + Bekk](https://elm-lang.org/news/elm-and-bekk) blog post by Evan celebrated Bekk's investment in Robin spending 1 day a week working on Elm.

Robin's work was mostly focused on [specific performance improvements to Elm core package primitives, i.e. Dict](https://groups.google.com/g/elm-dev/c/--fK-wMoDig/m/p6zF4-5sAgAJ), which was done in consultation with Evan.

According to Robin, Bekk stopped sponsoring his 20% time for internal reasons unrelated to Elm.
