Elmcraft is an unofficial endeavour, curated by a bunch of people who love and use Elm <img width="20" src="/images/elmcraft-heart-transparent.png" />.

Our goal is for Elmcraft to be the _official unofficial_ place for all things Elm.

There is a wealth of knowledge, projects, initiatives and people in the Elm community. Elmcraft is a map to help you find your way.


## Method

Elmcraft.org is a curated set of content using a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) approach.

> Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.

Though we are striving towards a beautiful and well tended garden!


### Markers

Elmcraft uses the following markers on certain content pages to help with context:

- ðŸŒ± **Seedling**: rough and early content, draft or notes
- ðŸª´ **Budding**: content that's mostly cleaned up and clarified
- ðŸŒ³ **Evergreen**: content that's reasonably complete, and tended to over time

If you find a content page without a marker, assume it is a rough draft that's not been tagged yet.


## Logo

The logo is a remix of the classic Elm tangram as a brick / building block, representing the craft of Elm. The gradient is a shoutout to the Elm blue as an origin, graduating into different shades representing the vibrancy of community projects built on top of it. It was designed by [Carla Kuchel](https://dribbble.com/carlakuchel).
